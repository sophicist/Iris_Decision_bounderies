# Iris_Decision_bounderies

The project involves creating four decision bounderies for classification models using the iris dataset.
the models are:
1. Logistic regression
2. Knn
3. Support vector machine
4. gradient boosted machine

first the data is cleaned abit through scaling and PCA. The decision bounderies are then plotted and compared.
